# Todo RESTful API With Go

Hello, this is my first Go project. The purpose of this project is to **train** my knowledge how to make simple RESTful API app (todo app) with Go.

### Features
Todo app feature list:
- User Register
- User Login
- Create Todo
- Update Todo
- Get Todo
- Delete Todo

This app will be integrated with flutter (android only) to simulate the RESTful API consumtion to this project.
Wish me luck :D.
